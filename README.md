# AI Chatbot Clone (React)

This project is a functional clone of an AI chatbot interface, built using React. It features a responsive chat interface that provides pre-written responses to user prompts and includes a seemingly functional OTP-based login system for demonstration purposes.

## 🚀 Features

  * **Interactive Chat Interface:** Users can type messages and receive immediate, pre-defined responses, mimicking a real-time conversation.
  * **Pre-written Prompts:** The chatbot is configured with a set of pre-programmed questions and answers for demonstration.
  * **OTP-Based Login (Simulated):** A user-friendly login page with an OTP (One-Time Password) input field. While the OTP generation and verification are simulated for front-end demonstration, it provides a realistic user experience.
  * **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across desktop and mobile devices.
  * **ReactJS Framework:** Built with React for a component-based, efficient, and scalable front-end architecture.
